Cancer is a disease with multifactorial etiology. Environment, lifestyle, and genetics are well-known mediators of oncogenic cellular transformation. However – with respect to individual malignancies – the relative contributions of these factors are difficult to discern and require knowledge derived from massive, multivariate datasets. Accordingly, the Pitt laboratory’s research program has two major aims: 1) the development of state-of-the-art software to facilitate data-intensive genomic analyses; and 2) the integration of inherited genetic variation, acquired mutations, and epidemiology to better understand cancer susceptibility and tumorigenesis. Using data science to unravel cancer’s origins can ultimately sharpen screening, early detection, and prophylactic treatment programs that are crucial to precision oncology.
